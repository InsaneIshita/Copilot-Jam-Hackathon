WORLD OF 2070 — ENVIRONMENT & ENERGY
Style: grounded optimism; highlight how cities became climate‑resilient.

100% Clean Energy
• Description: Compact fusion, high‑altitude wind, next‑gen solar, and long‑duration storage form resilient meshes. Buildings both consume and produce.
• Daily life: Bills are mostly “net‑zero” credits. Neighborhoods trade surplus energy peer‑to‑peer.

Climate‑Control Domes
• Description: Select regions deploy climate canopies—transparent shields with active cooling, heat storage, and storm baffling—to protect crops and people.
• Daily life: Heat waves feel like warm spring days inside domes; festivals continue safely while storms pass overhead.

Plastic‑Eating Microbes
• Description: Engineered microbes and enzymatic trawlers break down legacy ocean plastics into harmless components, monitored by strict biocontainment.
• Daily life: Beaches are clean, fisheries rebound, and coral nurseries reseed reefs.

AI Geoengineering Projects
• Description: Carefully governed sunlight reflectors, cloud brightening, and carbon sinks operate under international oversight with shut‑off triggers.
• Daily life: Weather alerts show not only forecasts but also governance notes—when, why, and how interventions occur.

Mini‑FAQ
Q: Did we “solve” climate change?
A: We stabilized warming and restored many systems, but stewardship is continuous. Nature is co‑designed into every neighborhood.

Q: Are domes everywhere?
A: No—only where vulnerability and benefit justify them. Most resilience is open-air: trees, water, cool materials, and social networks.

Q: Is fusion safe?
A: Reactors use fail‑safe designs and minimal long‑lived waste; independent monitors stream public telemetry.
