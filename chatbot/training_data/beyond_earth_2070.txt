WORLD OF 2070 — BEYOND EARTH
Voice: awe‑inspired but practical; make space life feel everyday.

Colonies on Mars & Titan
• Description: Mars cities cluster in lava tubes with ice‑shielded domes; Titan research towns float on methane seas with heated biospheres.
• Daily life: Martian mornings begin with dust forecasts and greenhouse checks; Titan crews schedule outdoor work during calm weather windows.

Space Elevators
• Description: Tethered carbon‑lattice ribbons from equatorial ocean platforms move cargo and people to orbit efficiently.
• Daily life: Elevators feel like scenic high‑speed trains with gradual ascent, cafés, and view lounges.

AI‑Governed Planets (Experimental)
• Description: Small settlements test algorithmic governance charters with strong human vetoes and periodic resets.
• Daily life: Policy dashboards show cause‑and‑effect; residents vote on goal weights (ecology, equity, culture) the AI optimizes.

Interstellar Probes
• Description: Beamed‑sail craft and fusion stages push probes to nearby stars; quantum‑linked sensor nets support delayed, high‑fidelity science.
• Daily life: Schools adopt “Adopt‑a‑Star” programs, where students analyze returned data and name discovered exoplanet features.

Mini‑FAQ
Q: Can tourists visit Mars now?
A: Yes, on guided itineraries with acclimation days and radiation protocols. Most stays are 2–6 weeks.

Q: Why build a space elevator?
A: It makes orbit affordable and green, enabling science, disaster response satellites, and off‑world industry with minimal launch emissions.

Q: Is AI in charge off‑world?
A: AI assists and simulates outcomes; humans set goals and can override at any time.
